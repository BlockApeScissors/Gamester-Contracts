# Gamester-Contracts

HISTORY

Gamesters are an NFT collection launched in 2021 on BNB Chain.

The approach was to create data structures onchain and mapping bits over to traits. 

Our source of randomness was Chainlink VRF v1.

This decentralised the actual creation of our collection, we then generated the images from the on chain seeds.

We successfully concluded the mint, selling all 10,000 NFTs in less than 24 hours.

It is the highest volume collection on Pancakeswap Marketplace after their own collections.

REBIRTH

The target is for Gamesters to be a community of gamers, helping games fix UX and improve in an
efficient manner, building on the success of communities like Neo Tokyo and Dokyo.

The scalability of the model will be the integration of other PFP communities within the same dapp, feeding
a piece of their revenues to the Gamester DAO.

Born from Chainlink, we will embrace the Chainlink techstack and operate crosschain

The plan:

Q1 2024

We need to:

- Create new Gamester SC on ETH with CCIP enabled Crosschain
- Create BNB -> ETH NFT Bridge & Mint mechanism
- Create new Art Collection -> Background Changes based on Chain

Migrate to ETH with new Art -> Blue and white futuristic Blocky Gamers

NFT Crosschain bridge from ETH using CCIP to:

AVAX,
BNB,
Arbitrum,
Polygon,
Optimism,
Base

Q2 2024

Gamester Platform - A Test & Earn Dapp for Gamers to provide high quality and structured feedback to Game Developers

How it works?

Testers need to stake Gamesters into the platform in order to unlock the opportunities and start earning.

The more Gamesters you stake, the more tester opportunities you can view and the more tasks you can accomplish.

Opportunities rotate based upon Smart contract encoded traits, meaning testers want a good mix of NFTs in their collection for max exposure.

The system self regulates, i.e. :

When a GAME entity wants to employ a Gamester, the payment is escrowed.

When the Gamester completes and submits the task, it is verified by a random other Gamester on the platform (within a timeframe).

If approved, the Gamester starts earning the payment (Games will have options between NFTs, vested tokens, etc, all crosschain, this is how we get max exposure).

There is also a Jury and Appeal system in place, i.e. :

Games can APPEAL the system for collusion between Gamester and Verifier in the case of poor feedback.

This randomly selects a jury of 5 people who verify the feedback, should they reach the conclusion the feedback is poor, the GAME retains their payment.

There are various controls for enforcement, e.g. As Gamesters are staked, upon appeal their NFTs can be locked into the contract for e.g. 3 months, blocking access or liquidity to their asset as a penalty.

Due to the self governing and horizontal aspect of this system the feedback will attract Gaming companies to extract high quality feedback.
