# Gamester-Contracts

HISTORY

Gamesters are an NFT collection launched in 2021 on BNB Chain.

The approach was to create data structures onchain and mapping bits over to traits. 

Our source of randomness was Chainlink VRF v1.

This decentralised the actual creation of our collection, we then generated the images from the on chain seeds.

We successfully concluded the mint, selling all 10,000 NFTs in less than 24 hours.

It is the highest volume collection on Pancakeswap Marketplace after their own collections.

REBIRTH

The target is for Gamesters to be a community of gamers, helping games fix UX and improve in an
efficient manner, building on the success of communities like Neo Tokyo and Dokyo.

The scalability of the model will be the integration of other PFP communities within the same dapp, feeding
a piece of their revenues to the Gamester DAO.

Born from Chainlink, we will embrace the Chainlink techstack and operate crosschain.

The plan:

Q1 2024

We need to:

- Create new Gamester SC on ETH with CCIP enabled Crosschain
- Create BNB -> ETH NFT Bridge & Mint mechanism
- Create new Art Collection -> Background Changes based on Chain

Migrate to ETH with new Art -> Blue and White futuristic Blocky Gamers

NFT Crosschain bridge from ETH using CCIP to:

AVAX,
BNB,
Arbitrum,
Polygon,
Optimism,
Base

Q2-Q3 2024

Gamester Platform - A Test & Earn Dapp for Gamers to provide high quality and structured feedback to Game Developers

Features:

- CCIP on 7 Chains
- Gamester Staking with Rating & Penalty system
- Gamester Job availability based on VRF & Keeper rotated Traits
- Gamester Appeal system to uphold high quality feedback
- Game onboarding with DAO approval and vested native crosschain native token payments

Q4 2024

We expand with a DAO governed extension module allowing other NFT collections to
enter the CCIP enabled platform as well as it's opportunities. 
Fees are then taken under the Gamester DAO.

This way we expand as a utility solution for all NFT collections.
